# Coding Rules

1. **Always comment on your code**: Ensure your teammates understand what you are doing.
2. **Practice proper variable naming**: Please name your variables relevantly, not randomly.
3. **Clean code above all**: We do not want a haywire eyesore for anyone to see.
4. **Test before pushing to main**: 
   - Test the code thoroughly.
   - Make sure there is a backup before pushing to the main branch, just in case.
5. **Document as you code**: 
   - Ensure proper acknowledgement of your work.
   - If no proper explanation for your code is provided, your credit will be lower in the workload matrix. No playing tricks on your teammates!!

Good luck, tech bros!
